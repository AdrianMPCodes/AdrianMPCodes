Hi, 

Iâ€™m Adrian Mendoza Perez. Currently, I'm a freshman at Stanford University 
studying computer science. I'm interested in AI and ethics. This summer,
I'm looking to  develop my skills further through internships. As right now, 
the classes I've took or am taking are:

> Programming Abstractions  
> Mathematical Foundations of Computing   
> Enrichment Adventures in Programming Abstractions
